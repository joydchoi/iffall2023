        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>

        <p>1. Hello, I am Joy Choi, a Communication Design Major, and I am a junior.</p>
        
        <p>2. I am from Georgia and have no experience with coding. I was prompted to take this class as it is required for my major, 
            but think it is a great opportunity to learn the basics.</p>
        
        <p>3. I do not have any experience with HTML/CSS.</p>

        <p>4. I hope to learn and understand the fundamentals of HTML and CSS and be able to put them into use.</p>

        <p>5. One big aspect are the quick changes I can make. Although on paper I can see immediate changes of sketches and erase unwanted markings 
            on my design, I feel like designing a screen requires a lot of trial and error of refreshing and checking what went wrong. </p>
        
        <p>6. Design wise, <a href= "https://www.pinterest.com/">Pinterest</a> uses algorithm well. It allows the user to find similar images by clicking the ones that catch their interest.</p>
        
        <p>7. <a href= "https://www.google.com/">Google</a> helps communicate to the user what information they are searching for. It included similar searches that relate to the question as well and provides a variety of information.</p>
        
        <p>8. I think <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a> is a well made website. It combines simple navigational methods with an organized design that lets the user use the website easily.</p>
