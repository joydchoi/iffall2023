                <h3>Meringue</h3>
                    <p>1. Preheat oven to 100C (212F) and line a parchment paper on an over rack, then set aside.</p>
                    <p>2. Crack the egg in a completely clean medium bowl and take out the egg yolk carefully with a spoon.</p>
                    <p>3. Beat the egg white until firm peaks. Then gradually add the sugar as stirring each time and beat until the mixture is shiny. Remove the beater and add the almond flour (ground almonds), then mix softly with a rubber spatula. </p>  
                    <p>4. Transfer the meringue into a piping bag with a large tip (I used star shape). Then pipe about 0.7 inches (2 cm) diameter round onto the prepared paper sheet.</p>

                    <p>5. Bake on 100C (212F) for 1 hour. After baking time, still leave the meringue in the oven door closed for 1 hour.</p>
                    <p>6. Remove the meringue from the oven and allow to cool completely. Then store in an airtight container. It can be kept crisp for up to 3 days at room temperature.

                    <h3>Chocolate Coating</h3>
                    <p>1. Pour water in a large saucepan over high heat. Once water boiled, bring to simmer.</p>
                    <p>2. Place the broken chocolate in the top of a double boiler or a heatproof bowl, and set over the saucepan. Stir occasionally until melted and smooth. Add 1-2 tbsp of milk (not in the ingredients) if the chocolate is too thick to brush.</p>
                    <p>3. Brush a thick layer of the chocolate evenly inside the tart shells with a pastry brush.</p>

                    <h3>Cream</h3>
                    <p>1. Pour the heavy whipping cream (double cream) into a large bowl and beat until firm peaks with an electric beater.</p>
                    <p>2. Separate the whipped cream in half. Place the half amount of whipped cream in a small bowl and set aside in fridge.</p>
                    <p>3. Add 120g (4oz) of the chestnut preserve and the dark rum into the remaining half whipped cream and beat until well combined, Transfer into a piping bag with a Mont Blanc tip. You can substitute for other small hole tips.</p>   
                    
                    <br>

                    <h3>Assemble</h3>

                    <p>2. Pipe the chestnut cream around the mini tower. Repeat the whole process for the rest of tart shells.</p>
                    <p>3. Top with the other meringue cookie if you want, and optionally dust powdered sugar.</p>
