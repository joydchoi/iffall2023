            <p class="p1">Isn't it a little late? <br>
                Shouldn't you fly away? <br>
                Little dove with cigarettes <br>
                Show 'em that you can hold your breath</p>

            <h2>[Pre-Chorus]</h2>
            <p class="p1">I heard about a girl <br>
                Buried her dolls and lost her curls <br>

            <p class="p1">Walk into a smoke-filled room <br>
                Oh, no one could keep their eyes off you <br>
                Have a little drink or two <br>
                Oh, how could you be that girl I knew? <br>

                Little black dress and mama's shoes <br>
                Isn't it a bit too soon? <br>
                Oh, how could you be that girl I knew? <br>

                Walk into a smoke-filled room <br>
                Oh, I believe love will follow you <br>
                Isn't it a bit too soon? <br>
                Oh, oh, how could you be that girl I knew? <br>
