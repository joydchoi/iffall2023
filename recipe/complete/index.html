          <h3>What is Mont Blanc Cake?</h3>
          <p class="blah">It's a very simple Japanese-style Mont Blanc, chestnut cream dessert recipe. This snowy mountain look of the cake, following the meaning of the name in French, is the perfect winter dessert for Christmas holiday through daily snack. Store-bought mini tart shells and <a href="https://bonnemaman.com.au/products/chestnut-cream">Bonne Maman chestnut preserve</a> allow you to make Mont Blanc cake so easily. So thus, you will only need to prepare meringue cookies, melted chocolate and whipped cream. As the chestnut preserve contains a lot of sweetness, you won't add any sugar to make chestnut cream. Meringue cookie can still be crispy for up to 3 days, so there is an option making them on another day for the rest of the steps.</p>
          
          <h3>What is Mont Blanc Cake in Japan?</h3>
          <p class="blah">The reason I said this recipe, Japanese-style Mont Blanc, is because just I've never had traditional French or Italian Mont blanc cake. This recipe has been inspired from all that I'd eaten in Japan. There are various tastes: chestnut, chocolate, strawberry, sweet potato and green tea. it's nationwide popular dessert that you can buy them any patisseries even at convenience stores just around the corner.
        
          I think that we call “Mont Blanc” if it has some kind of base and top with spaghetti-like strings cream from a specific piping tip. Generally the base is a sponge cake, sliced rolled cake, meringue or tart. And under the chestnut cream, chestnut puree or a candied Chestnut is hidden with whipped cream. This is one of the typical combination of Japanese Mont blanc. You can enjoy the delicious contrast of textures, along with rich flavorful chestnut cream. It's very nice to pair with a cup of black coffee. I hope you have a good time in winter with this simple Mont blanc tart.</p>
